- to provide captive elephants with individualized care, the companionship of a herd, and the opportunity to live out their lives in a safe haven dedicated to their well-being
- to raise public awareness of the complex needs of elephants in captivity and the crisis facing elephants in the wild

Since 1995, The Sanctuary has provided refuge for 28 elephants retired from performance and exhibition. Elephants that have lived their lives in captivity have an opportunity at The Sanctuary to live in an expansive 3,000+ acre habitat that allows for a range of natural behaviors. Many of the elephants suffer long-term health and complex behavioral issues common to elephants that have spent their lives in captivity, such as tuberculosis, osteomyelitis, obesity, arthritis and aggression. Because elephants have complex physical and social needs, successful outcomes are measured not only by the elephant's physical health, but also their social, behavioral and psychological well-being.

As a true sanctuary, The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee is closed to the public. 

However, The Sanctuary believes increasing public knowledge is key to creating a world where elephants no longer live under constant threat of poaching, habitat loss, conflict, or capture. The Elephant Discovery Center in downtown Hohenwald offers hands-on self-guided exhibits and educational programming that explores the many ways elephants shape our world. Through Distance Learning, The Sanctuary teaches hundreds of school and community groups around the world a respect for wildlife while learning about the crisis facing Asian and African elephants in captivity and in the wild. ",FALSE,https://ddb9l06w3jzip.cloudfront.net/uploadedFiles/giving_cfmt/organizations/logo/309?thumbnail=1&maxWidth=290&maxHeight=164

The Ranch also serves as a foster home for horses recovering from abuse and neglect in Middle Tennessee. Participants are offered the opportunity to assist in the rehabilitation process of caring for abused and neglected equines.

Residents arrive extremely vulnerable-newly sober, but without jobs or financial skills, in poor physical health, and with undiagnosed psychiatric conditions. Most have experienced abuse or trauma in childhood, and their addiction has damaged family relationships - including loss of custody of their children.

HH takes a whole-person approach to help each woman meet her goals, including case management, individual and group therapy, medical management, psychological evaluation and follow-up, a female-specific Intensive Outpatient Program, medical and dental care, plus career training. Residents also participate in financial planning, relapse prevention, workshops and spiritual formation classes. This holistic treatment model is rare for marginalized women in our community.

As a non-profit, Mid-South Liver Alliance relies on donors and grants to support the mission with liver patients. All funds are used to further educational and outreach activities within our member states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Within our area of the United States, we understand that liver disease will strike approximately 1 in every 4 people, and we recognize that within our states, there are lifestyle and access to healthcare issues that leave people more at-risk for liver disease and undiagnosed or untreated liver disease.    Our goal is to help get the word out on NAFLD/NASH and on chronic liver disease in general.    Our Medical Advisory board is made up of 8 of the 11 transplant centers that are located in our 6 states.    The transplant centers typically house hepatologists, as many people with chronic liver disease end up needing a transplant to make their liver healthy.

Professional therapists, both locally and around the country, confirm the efficacy of our materials.

About Us:  NYSC was launched in 2012 by Upward Unlimited.  However, in 2019,  Upward Unlimited chose to focus all time, energy, and resources on Upward Sports (church recreation division).   As of 10/1/19,  NYSC is a stand-alone, 501(c)(3) organization - an independent basketball club operated out of Brentwood, TN.  While the legal name did not change (Nashville Youth Sports Club, Inc.), the assumed name changed from Upward Stars Basketball to STARS Basketball Club on 10/1/19. 

Growth:   NYSC has quickly become the largest basketball club in Middle TN, and perhaps the state.  Our coaching staff (50+) has countless opportunities to impact athletes both ON & OFF the court, being MORE THAN Basketball!  One primary focus is the development of  the total athlete:  MENTALLY, ATHLETICALLY, SPIRITUALLY,  and SOCIALLY.  These four pillars of impact are derived from Luke 2:52 - ""And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.""

Coaches/ Character Lessons:  One way in which the ""Off the Court"" impact is accomplished is through character lessons.  Our coaching staff has shared over 2,000 character lessons w/athletes over the past five years at team practices and/or at clinics/camps.  These lessons are based on Scripture and correlate with sports and every-day life.  Character lesson topics, just to list a few, have included:  Teamwork, Character, Wisdom, Leadership, Perseverance, Effort, Discipline, Integrity, Accountability, & Courage. 

Putting a Quality Product on the Court:  From a sports' credibility perspective, the club's 2021 spring/summer tournament teams competed at a high-level, having won 80+ Championships, earning 90+ runner-up finishes, & 100+ semi-final appearances in national/regional/& local tournaments.  In 2022, 8 teams will compete on the UA FUTURE Circuit, with 2 teams on the UA RISE Circuit.",FALSE,https://ddb9l06w3jzip.cloudfront.net/uploadedFiles/giving_cfmt/organizations/logo/849?thumbnail=1&maxWidth=290&maxHeight=164

That, everyone should remain active as long as he/she can and do the most important thing he/she can do.

That, unless the American Dream come true for our older generation, it cannot be true or complete for any generation.
That, the personal growth, and volunteer community service offers the most rewarding form of activity when pensions take place of payrolls.
That, the majority of Americans in this country over 65 years of age are eager and able to play a continuing role as active participants in the life of our country.
Encouraging them to play this role is the cornerstone of this organization.
That, we fully recognize what America must do for its older citizens, and one which fully appreciates what are older citizens can do for America.
That, the Christian ethic as set forth in the parable of talents applies to people of all ages; we are all Trustees.
That, as much money and effort should be spent upon adult education as upon youth education, with emphasis upon the Humanities.

Bring people together in harmony and fellowship to enrich lives through singing.

VISION:

""Everyone In Harmony.""

THE ""BIG IDEA"":

A substantial body of scholarly research points to seven key points of value when people sing together:

1.  When people sing together, their lives are improved at many levels - physical, emotional, psychological, social and spiritual.
2.  When people sing together, their communities are healthier.
3.  When young people receive music education and sing together, it helps them learn, develop, and become healthier adults.
4.  When people sing together across generations, it enhances the lives of all the generations.
5.  When people sing together across cultures or groups, it unifies them and reduces barriers between groups.
6.  When men sing together, it helps them become better men, and when young men sing together, it helps them develop a healthy identity.
7.  When people facing significant challenges sing together, it helps them with those challenges, and is likely to help society address those issues as well.

If singing together is good, more singing together would be even better.  But there are several barriers to singing together, barriers that barbershop is uniquely suited to overcome.  Thus, getting people to sing together is the focus of all of our work.  

The big idea behind Everyone In Harmony is that the mysterious alchemy and joy of singing together is too wonderful for us to keep to ourselves.  It is a gift that we are not only compelled to share, but one that we have the capability, resources and unity of purpose to share with young and old, with people of every color and every strata, with city people and country people and everyone in between, because the world needs what we have.

Harmony compels us to blend, to cooperate, to create beauty.  Indeed, to love each other.  We think of the gift of harmony as not just for our own enjoyment, but as a tool for direct social impact.

The UniCycle Closet program provides school clothing to students in need within the Metro Nashville Public School system by collecting gently-used items in schools and distributing them at the school level and through a spartnership with the Homeless Education Resource Office.  We answer the question of ""What can I do with my child's outgrown school clothing?"" while removing an obstacle to education for students in need, lessening the workload for MNPS support staff, offering more clothing choices to students whose families have limited budgets, and giving new life to clothing that is ""outgrown, not worn out.""

HERO Family Fund

The HERO Family Fund was launched in 2023 and allows HERO outreach workers to provide basic, critical needs to families immediately. The fund is used for items that are integral to a student or family's progress, but are not readily available through other community resources. Examples include gas cards or ride-share vouchers; medications or specific healthcare or hygiene products; critical household essentials and work-related items. 

We firmly believe that access to school uniforms and basic needs are obstacles to education that can be resolved on the community level, and that by doing so, we can not only bring positive attention to the more than 3,000 students navigating unstable housing each year in our city, but also free up time and resources on the school support staff end so that everyone can better focus on their own piece of the network that it takes to support our most vulnerable students.

Our work preserves affordable housing. Over 50% of existing housing units in middle Tennessee are single unit homes lived in by the homeowner. Preserving these homes is key to affordable housing.

Solve a crisis with us: As home prices and construction costs continue to soar, Middle Tennessee will never be able to build its way out of the affordable housing crisis. The Westminster Home Connection model preserves the affordability of existing homes at a nominal cost by ensuring they're livable for the current homeowners.

Serving Middle Tennesseans in seven counties, our construction teams resolve safety, mobility, and functionality issues, including step-in bathtubs, wheelchair ramps, electrical issues, and leaky pipes, that might otherwise cause homeowners to be forced to leave their homes.
